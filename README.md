# FastAI-Keras
Using libraries & building custom and pre-trained models using FastAI, HuggingFace transformers, and Keras for a variety of deep learning tasks.

# Tabular

Using FastAI & HuggingFace transformers.

# Text

Using FastAI, HuggingFace, and Keras-NLP.

## Keras NLP (Natural Language Processing)
In the */Keras/Keras-NLP* directory I build, test & finetune a Language Model using Keras NLP, useful for connecting text data to the model.

# Vision

Using FastAI, HuggingFace, and Keras-Vision.

## Keras CV (Computer Vision)
In the */Keras/Keras-Vision* directory I build, finetune and test a
 YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model.

# Audio

Using HuggingFace transformers.
