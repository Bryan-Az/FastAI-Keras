# HuggingFace

## Tabular

I use tabular data to create a custom classification model that uses  data environmental impact from a variety of buisness metrics.

## Text
I build three variant text models, 
1. A named entity recognition model
2. A summarization model
3. A translation model

## Vision

I implement a zero shot object classification model using HuggingFace vision transformer models. I will be using the Fashion-MNIST for this section.
