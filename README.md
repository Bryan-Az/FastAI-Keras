# FastAI-Keras
Using libraries & building custom and pre-trained models using FastAI, HuggingFace transformers, and Keras for a variety of deep learning tasks.

# Tabular

Using FastAI & HuggingFace transformers. The data for this section was taken from the secondary Kaggle dataset source 'Corporate Environmental Impact' by Arman and Rebecca Verghese.

# Text

Using FastAI, HuggingFace, and Keras-NLP.

## Fast AI

### Product Recommendation

In the *FastAI/Text-Model* directory, I build and test a product recommendation text model using Fast AI.

The secondary source for this data in this section was taken from Prof. Julian McCauley's database in the department of computer science at UC San Diego. [Link](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/)

The primary source for the data is from the research paper: 

Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fined-grained aspects

## Keras 

### NLP (Natural Language Processing)
In the */Keras/Keras-NLP* directory I build, test & finetune a Language Model using Keras NLP, useful for connecting text data to the model.

# Vision

Using FastAI, HuggingFace, and Keras-Vision.

## Keras CV (Computer Vision)
In the */Keras/Keras-Vision* directory I build, finetune and test a
 YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model.

# Audio

Using HuggingFace transformers.
