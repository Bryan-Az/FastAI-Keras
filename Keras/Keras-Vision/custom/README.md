# Custom Vision Model using Keras
In this section, I will train a custom vision model (from scratch!) using the Fashion-MNIST dataset of images.

An example of how the MNIST data will be loaded is:
```
# To load the dataset, use this python code
# the datasets library can be installed
# using the environment.yml file in the Fast-AI directory
fashion_mnist = datasets.load_dataset(fashion_mnist)
```
