# Keras NLP (Natural Language Processing)
In this directory I build and test Keras NLP for various NLP tasks useful for connecting data to a LLM (Large Language Model). 

I use a pre-trained classifier & run an ablation experiment where I finetune this classifier using a variety of finetuning methods (i.e a pretrained 'backbone', then user-controlled preprocessing, and finally custom modules).

The 'X' dataset for this section is the 'reviewText' feature of the Amazon fashion product reviews dataset. 
The 'y' dataset for this section is the 'overall' feature that signals a user's star rating.
