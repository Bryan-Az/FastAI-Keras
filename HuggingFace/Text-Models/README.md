## Text
In this section I will continue using the Amazon fashion product reviews dataset.


I build three variant text models to accomplish different text tasks, 
1. A named entity recognition model: To extract product (named entities) names from the reviews (we have the product code but no product names).
2. A summarization model: To summarize long text reviews
3. A translation model: To translate reviews from english to spanish language
