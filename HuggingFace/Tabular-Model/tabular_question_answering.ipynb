This section will improve on the work done in that section and apply another preprocessing step in the ETL section. Based on the outcome of the regressor model, splitting the data features for each safeguard subject may help increase the signal of the environmental cost based on revenue. \n",

    "The dataset contains these main safeguard subjects containing environmental cost according to these industry segments. Previously, the data for each feature was combined into a single numerical value which gave poor results. A better method may be to split the tuple value for each feature into another feature. For example human_health1, human_health2, etc, based on the number of tuple value per record for that feature. Since this is a variable value due to missingness, a better method may be to create the n number of features based on the median length of the tuples for each individual feature and then fill in the records having less than the median with an imputation of the mean for the missing tuple index based on the mean of that tuple index for that feature.\n",
