# Pre-Trained Vision Model using Keras
In this section, I will finetune a pre-trained vision model (that was NOT trained to classify images of clothing) using the Fashion-MNIST dataset of images.

Hypothesis: Using a pre-trained vision keras model as a backbone, we can learn to detect objects in full color images,

## Finetuning using VITON

Goal: To improve the ability of the pre-trained vision model backbone at detecting images of articles of clothing.
